.. _det_simulation:

Deterministic simulation   
============

This functionality provides an interface to run simulation of the deterministic model with a specific interface for setting the options for DYNARE simul command (see figures below).

On the left part of the screen user can defined temporary and permanent shocks.

On the right part of the screen model variables are grouped and displayed as defined in :ref:`model settings<model_settings_variables>`. Only variables that have shown attribute set are displayed on this screen.

After user defines :ref:`simul command options<det_simulation_options>`, deterministic simulation is performed. This is done with internal function call to DYNAREâ€™ ``simul()`` function.
