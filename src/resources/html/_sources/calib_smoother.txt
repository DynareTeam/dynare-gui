.. _calib_smoother:

Calibrated smoother
============

This functionality provides an interface to run calibrated smoother with a specific interface for setting the options for DYNARE calib_smoother command (see figures below). 

Calibrated smoother computes the smoothed variables (and the filtered variables) on a calibrated model. This is done with internal function call to DYNARE’ ``evaluate_smoother()`` function.

On the left part of the screen model variables are grouped and displayed as defined in :ref:`model settings<model_settings_variables>`. Only variables that have shown attribute set are displayed on this screen.

On the right part of the screen calib_smoother command options are displayed as defined in DYNARE’ reference manual (datafile, filtered_vars and filter_step_ahead).

User defined values are stored in ``model_settings.calib_smoother`` structure.

In addition, two checkboxes are provided: to select (consider) all endogenous variables and to select only observed variables.

Browse results functionality displays calibrated smoother results.

Results are grouped in two parts and displayed in hierarchical (tree) GUI component (uitree Matlab component):
	* Figures generated by Dynare
	* Structures generated by Dynare.

Part Figures generated by Dynare includes all figures (.fig files) generated by DYNARE for smoothed variables, smoothed shocks and updated variables.

Part Structures generated by Dynare displays fields of ``oo_.SmoothedVariables, oo_.SmoothedShocks and oo_.UpdatedVariables`` DYNARE structures.

User selects which result to view with a click on corresponding tree node. Results are displayed as new figures next to the window with tree component (see figure below).
