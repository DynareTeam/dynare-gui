Forecast
============

This functionality provides an interface for forecast (see figures below).

On the left part of the screen model variables are grouped and displayed as defined in :ref:`model settings<model_settings_variables>`. Only variables that have shown attribute set are displayed on this screen.

Forecast is done with internal function calls to DYNAREâ€™ ``smoother2histval()`` and ``dyn_forecast()`` functions.

On the right part of the screen option number of forecast periods for dyn_forecast function is displayed, together with option for smoother2histval function: start at historic period.

	* Figures generated by Dynare
	* Structures generated by Dynare.

Part Figures generated by Dynare includes all forecast figures (.fig files) generated by DYNARE.

Part Structures generated by Dynare displays fields of ``oo_.SmoothedVariables`` DYNARE structure.

User selects which result to view with a click on corresponding tree node. Results are displayed as new figures next to the window with tree component (see figure below).
