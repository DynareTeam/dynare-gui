.. _conditional_forecast_options:

Define conditional forecast options   
============

This functionality defines options for conditional_forecast and plot_conditional_forecast commands. Functionality is triggered with “Define command options” button on :ref:`conditional forecast screen<conditional_forecast>`and new modal (child) screen for defining options is displayed (see figure below).

All conditional_forecast and plot_conditional_forecast commands options as defined in the DYNARE’ reference manual are saved in Dynare_GUI internal structure. This structure is called ``dynare_gui_`` and has a separate substructure ``dynare_gui_.conditional_forecast`` for these two commands options. 

All command options are classified in one group: setup, which has corresponding Matlab cell structure.

Besides fields to enter new value for command options, current values and DYNARE’ default values are displayed.

User can define his/her own command options defaults. They are saved in ``model_settings.defaults.conditional_forecast`` structure when command button “Save as default options” is pressed. Default options are loaded with “Load default options button”. 

When user clicks “Use this options” button, modal screen for defining options is closed and user is back on :ref:`conditional forecast screen<conditional_forecast>`. In the bottom part of the screen defined options for conditional_forecast and plot_conditional_forecast command are displayed (panel with a title “Current command options”).
