.. _project_save_as:

Save project as
============

This functionality allows saving of all project related variables in a new project (.dproj) file. 

All project related information is displayed, similarly to :ref:`Save Project <project_save>` functionality, with the option to change project name as well.

Functionality is also very similar to the :ref:`New Project <project_new>` functionality, with the difference that project related variables are not created, but copied from the current project.
