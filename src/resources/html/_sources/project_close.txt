.. _project_close:

Close project
============

This functionality closes current project (only one project at a time can be opened). It also allows user to save any modifications to the current project (before closing it).

All opened tabs are closed at this point. Also appropriate menu options are disabled (Save Project, Save Project As, Close Project and all options under Model, Estimation, Simulation and Output submenus).
