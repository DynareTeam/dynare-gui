Conditional forecast
============

This functionality provides an interface for conditional forecast (see figure below).

On the left part of the screen user can defined specific conditions - paths of constrained endogenous variables. This part of functionality is an interface for DYNARE’ command conditional_forecast_paths.

On the right part of the screen model variables are grouped and displayed as defined in :ref:`model settings<model_settings_variables>`. Only variables that have shown attribute set are displayed on this screen.

Conditional forecast is done with internal function calls to DYNARE’ ``imcforecast()`` and ``plot_icforecast()`` functions.

User is shown graphs as they are computed and generated by DYNARE ``plot_icforecast()`` function.
