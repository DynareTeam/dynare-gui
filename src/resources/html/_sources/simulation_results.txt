============

This functionality displays stochastic simulation results.

Results are grouped in two parts displayed in hierarchical (tree) GUI component (uitree Matlab component):
	* Figures generated by Dynare
	* Structures generated by Dynare.

Part Figures generated by Dynare includes all IRF figures (.fig files) generated by DYNARE.

Part Structures generated by Dynare displays fields of ``oo_.irfs and oo_.endo_simul`` DYNARE structures.

User selects which result to view with a click on corresponding tree node. Results are displayed as new figures next to the window with tree component (see figure below).
