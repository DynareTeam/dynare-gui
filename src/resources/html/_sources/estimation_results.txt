============

This functionality displays estimation results.

Results are grouped in two parts displayed in hierarchical (tree) GUI component (uitree Matlab component):
	* Figures generated by Dynare
	* Structures generated by Dynare.

Part Figures generated by Dynare includes all figures (.fig files) generated by DYNARE for priors, mode checks, forecast, smoothed variables, smoothed shocks, updated variables, filtered variables, posterior IRFs, MCMC univariate convergence diagnostic and convergence diagnostics of Geweke.

Part Structures generated by Dynare displays fields of corresponding DYNARE structures.

User selects which result to view with a click on corresponding tree node. Results are displayed as new figures next to the window with tree component (see figure below).
