Introduction
============

This documentation describes main functionalities of DYNARE graphical user interface (Dynare_GUI) that supports end-users, such as policy makers, in studying and analysing of economic models.  

End users do not need to know details of models and functionalities/commands of the underlying DYNARE Matlab toolbox.

Dynare_GUI provides Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the set of standard DYNARE functionalities for allowing easy visualization of the modeling results, but also making policy simulations, scenarios and forecasts in a straightforward way. Dynare_GUI  allows users to use benefits of stochastic and deterministic modeling in DYNARE without excessive knowledge of DYNARE and MATLAB.

Dynare_GUI  supports following major functionalities:
	* project creation and modification
	* model specifications and modifications
	* model estimations and simulations
	* visualization of the modeling results
	* conditional forecast 
	* forecast and 
	* shocks decomposition.
