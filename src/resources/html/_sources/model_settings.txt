This functionality provides interface for defining model settings regarding variables, parameters and shocks (see figures below).These model settings are used in various functionalities of Dynare_GUI application. They can be also used to generate new .mod/dyn file.

Model settings are saved in MATLAB structure named model_settings. This structure is stored in project (.dproj) file.

Model settings are saved/overridden each time user presses “Save settings” button.

Model settings regarding variables, parameters and shocks are defined in separate sub-tabs of model settings screen.
