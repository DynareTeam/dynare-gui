Stochastic simulation   
============

This functionality provides an interface to run stochastic simulation of the model with a specific interface for setting the options for DYNARE stoch_simul command (see figure below).

Model shocks and variables are grouped and displayed as defined in :ref:`model settings<model_settings>`. Only shocks and variables that have shown attribute set are displayed on this screen.

After user defines :ref:`stoch_simul command options<simulation_options>`, simulation is performed. This is done with internal function call to DYNAREâ€™ ``stoch_simul()`` function.
