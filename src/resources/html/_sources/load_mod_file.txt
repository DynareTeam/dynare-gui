.. _load_mod_file:

Load .mod file
============

This functionality provides an interface to load and execute .mod/.dyn file with a specific interface for setting the options for dynare command (see figures below).

If .mod/.dyn file has not been set for the current project, application first ask user to select .mod/.dyn file with standard file browsing interface. Specified .mod/.dyn file is copied to the project folder. The .mod/.dyn file should include only  model parameters, variables and equations. Any other DYNARE commands should be commented out. 

If commands steady & check are not included in .mod/.dyn file application issue a warning and inserts these commands to the.mod/.dyn file. Similarly, if user has selected in project specific settings option “always create LATEX representation of the model”, .application will check if command write_latex_dynamic_model exists in the mod/.dyn file and if not present, it will insert it. 

Once the .mod/.dyn file has been set, it is displayed it in a read-only mode to the user (see figure below).

After user defines .mod/.dyn file and :ref:`dynare command options<define_dynare_comm>`, initialization is performed – DYNARE is loading the model specified in the .mod/.dyn file. This is done with ``dynare <mod_file_name>`` command.

In case of DYNARE error, details about error are provided to the user. 

After successful execution of .mod/dyn file, DYNARE structures ``oo_, M_, options_`` , etc. will be present in MATLAB workspace. 

Also, at this moment all menu options under the Model submenu are enabled. In addition, if model_settings have been already defined, all menu options under the Estimation, Simulation and Output submenus are enabled.
