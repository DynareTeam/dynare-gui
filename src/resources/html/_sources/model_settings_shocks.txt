Model settings: shocks
============

This functionality allows settings for the model shocks (see figures below).

Model shocks, as read from the .mod/.dyn file, are displayed in an editable table. For each shock following information is displayed:
	* name of the shock in DYNARE model (this field is only not editable field in this table); initial values are copied from ``M_.exo_names``
	* DYNARE LATEX name for the shock; initial values are copied from ``M_.exo_names_tex``
	* DYNARE long name for the shock; initial values are copied from ``M_.exo_names_long``
	* current value, estimated value and STD (for stochastic models only) 
		* current value is copied from ``M_.Sigma_e`` (sqrt of ``M_.Sigma_e`` value)
		* estimated value (posterior mean or mode) and STD are displayed only after estimation command has been run
	* initval (for deterministic models only) is initially copied from ``oo_.exo_steady_state``, and later from ``ex0_``
	* show/hide indicator which defines whether or not shock will be shown in estimation/simulation options
	* name of the group that shock belongs to (user can create arbitrary number of groups by entering different values in this field for different shocks); with this functionality grouping of shock is achieved 
	* show/hide group indicator â€“ foe the convenience ability to show/hide group of shocks
	* rename group - for the convenience ability to rename group of shocks by entering new name for any shock that belongs to corresponding group.

For stochastic models, shocks correlations are displayed in a separate table, which is also editable table. Initial values are copied from ``M_.Correlation_matrix``.
