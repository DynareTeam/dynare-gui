.. _change_mod_file:

Change .mod file
============

This functionality allows user to specify new .mod/.dyn file for the current project with a standard file browsing interface. 

After new .mod/dyn file has been specified, it should be executed in the same manner as described in :ref:`Load .mod file <load_mod_file>`.

This functionality is initiated with “Specify .mod file” button (see figure below).
