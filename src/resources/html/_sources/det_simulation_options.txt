.. _det_simulation_options:

Define deterministic simulation options   
============

This functionality defines stoch_simul command options. Functionality is triggered with “Define command options” button on :ref:`deterministic simulation screen<det_simulation>` and new modal (child) screen for defining options is displayed (see figure below).

All simul command options as defined in the DYNARE’ reference manual are saved in Dynare_GUI internal structure. This structure is called ``dynare_gui_`` and has a separate substructure ``dynare_gui_.simul`` for simul command options. 

All command options are classified in two groups: setup and solver, and each of the groups has corresponding Matlab cell structure.

Besides fields to enter new value for command options, current values and DYNARE’ default values are displayed.

User can define his/her own command options defaults. They are saved in ``model_settings.defaults.simul`` structure when command button “Save as default options” is pressed. Default options are loaded with “Load default options button”. 

When user clicks “Use this options” button, modal screen for defining options is closed and user is back on :ref:`deterministic simulation screen<det_simulation>`. In the bottom part of the screen defined options for simul command are displayed (panel with a title “Current command options”).
