Model settings: variables
============

This functionality allows settings for the model variables (see figure below).

Model variables, as read from the .mod/.dyn file, are displayed in an editable table. For each variable following information is displayed:
	* name of the variable in the DYNARE model (this field is only not editable field in this table); initial values are copied from ``M_.endo_names``
	* DYNARE LATEX name for the variable; initial values are copied from ``M_.endo_names_tex``
	* DYNARE long name for the variable; initial values are copied from ``M_.endo_names_long``
	* show/hide indicator which defines whether or not variable will be shown in estimation/simulation options
	* name of the group that variable belongs to (user can create arbitrary number of groups by entering different values in this field for different variables); with this functionality grouping of variables is achieved 
	* show/hide group indicator â€“ for the convenience ability to show/hide group of variables
	* rename group - for the convenience ability to rename group of variables by entering new name for any variable that belongs to corresponding group.

Auxiliary variables are automatically grouped in AUX group and hidden by default.
